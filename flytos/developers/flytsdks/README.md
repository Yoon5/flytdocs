# FlytSDKs

FlytOS abstracts out the intricacies of drone autopilot and provides high level APIs in CPP, Python, ROS, REST and Web-socket. This makes it easy for the developer community to start building apps for drones. To take it even further, we have put together SDKs for Web and Mobile app development. The SDKs give you a head-start in your app development by providing following:

* Necessary client libraries are pre-integrated
* In-built mechanism for establishing connection with the drone
* Sample REST call
* Sample Web-socket call
* Complete sample app project
