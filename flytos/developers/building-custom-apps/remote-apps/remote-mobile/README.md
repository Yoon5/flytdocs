# Remote Mobile

These apps run on a mobile device and communicate with the drone using RESTful and WebSocket FlytAPIs. These apps can be built in native languages like Java-for-Android or using cross-platform frameworks like Cordova. Samples for remote mobile apps are available in [Flytsamples github](https://github.com/flytbase/flytsamples/tree/master/Mobile-Apps).

### **Android-Apps**

These are native Android apps built using java and Android Studio. This approach provides full flexibility in terms of native support for the platform. We have put together an [Android SDK](https://github.com/flytbase/flytsamples/raw/master/Mobile-Apps/Java-Apps/FlytSDK/FlytSDK.jar) for Flytbase to help you get started with your custom Android app. [Read more](http://docs.flytbase.com/docs/FlytOS/Developers/BuildingCustomApps/RemoteMobile/RemoteAndroidApps.html#write-remote-mobile-android).

### **HTML-JS-Apps**

These apps are built using web technologies - HTML/JS/CSS and Cordova framework. Using cordova the app can be converted to desired target platform like Android, iOS or Blackberry etc. This is a good option for quick prototyping and building cross platform apps.
