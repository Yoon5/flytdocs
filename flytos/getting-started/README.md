# Getting Started

FlytOS is the software framework of FlytBase. It is based on Linux and ROS \(Robot Operating System\) making it an ideal platform for research and commercial drone applications. It can interact with any compatible drone/autopilot using its adapter layer and exposes high level FlytAPIs in ROS, CPP, Python, REST and Web-socket. It makes it easy to integrate custom payload and also provides advanced APIs using its onboard modules. These rich set of APIs allow for easy development of onboard business logic as well as remote monitoring and control through web and mobile apps. The modular design of FlytOS allows for integration with external ROS/Linux libraries and custom data plumbing between onboard and off-board apps.
