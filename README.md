# Welcome to FlytDocs

FlytBase is the next generation platform for commercial drone applications. It is by design open for developers to build advanced drone applications using its open APIs. FlytBase offers FlytOS which is a software framework for drones along with FlytSIM, the simulation environment and FlytSDKs, the web and mobile app development kits. Currently supported autopilot stacks include PX4 and APM. Supported companion computers include Raspberry Pi3, NVIDIA TX1, NVIDIA Nano, Intel Edison, Intel Aero and ODROID-XU4

**FlytOS** is based on Linux and ROS \(Robot Operating System\) making it an ideal platform for research and commercial drone applications. It can interact with any compatible drone/autopilot using its adapter layer and exposes high level FlytAPIs in ROS, CPP, Python, REST and Web-socket. It makes it easy to integrate custom payload and also provides advanced APIs using its onboard modules. These rich set of APIs allow for easy development of onboard business logic as well as remote monitoring and control through web and mobile apps. The modular design of FlytOS allows for integration with external ROS/Linux libraries and custom data plumbing between onboard and off-board apps. The vision of FlytOS is to provide a standard language for the drone developers to talk to their drones.

**FlytSIM** offers a SITL\(Software In The Loop\) simulation environment for testing user apps without the drone hardware. Applications developed using FlytAPIs can be tested in FlytSim, before deploying on actual drones. This offers developers a pleasant drone application development experience, while keeping it safe, and saving them huge amount of time and effort.

**FlytSDKs** are web and mobile app development kits to give you a head-start in building your apps using FlytAPIs. FlytSDKs simplify development by providing pre-integrated client libraries, mechanism to connect to the drone and a complete sample project with REST and Web Socket calls.

**FlytPi** is a turnkey companion computer pre-loaded with FlytOS Commercial Edition for Pixhawk / Pixhawk Mini / Pixhawk2 / Cube Autopilot. Simply connect FlytPi to your drone autopilot with a specially designed cable and enhance the capabilities of your drone.

**FlytBase Cloud** is industryâ€™s first Drone-API As A Service. It provides APIs for real-time secure access to drone navigation, payload and telemetry over 4G/LTE. It also provides easy integration with variety of 3rd party apps to help developers create custom workflows to suit different business needs.

This documentation gives all the inputs to get you started with FlytBase. You can learn about FlytOS and get a detailed reference for all the [FlytAPIs](http://api.flytbase.com/). It provides a step by step guide to install and get started with drone application development. You can refer to the sample apps and start building your own onboard and web/mobile apps.
